You can find a cached copy of the task-description in "ICFPC20_Task.pdf" here.
You can also find a snapshot of the "interaction-protocol files" in the
archive "ICFPC20_Probs.txz" here - the "galaxy.txt" file contains the code for
the Galaxy Simulator needed by the Galaxy Pad below.

* Running The Galaxy Pad

To build the Galaxy Pad UI here, you will need at least Go 1.14 and the SDL2
library (including SDL_gfx). To run it, update "IP_FILE" in "app/Makefile" and
then "make run" inside the "app" directory.

To quit the Galaxy Pad UI, press ESC (or just close the window). To auto-inject
mouse-clicks (e.g. while running battle-simulations), press the SPACE key;
press the SPACE key again to disable this auto-injection.
