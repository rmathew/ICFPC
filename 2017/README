An embarrassingly-naive Lambda Punter for the ICFP contest 2017 by Ranjit

NOTE: The "punter" at the top-level is just a shell-script that invokes the
real Python program in "src/punter_main.py" using a Python 2.17+ interpreter.
It thus needs access to the file-system to read the Python script and its
dependent scripts.
